# Obie Challenge

Listed below are some technologies used for this project:

## Frontend

- React
- TypeScript
- Jest
- SCSS
- Vite

## Backend

- TypeScript
- Hono
- Drizzle ORM
- SQLite db
- Google sheets API
- Jest

### If I had more time

- Would've liked to set up some sort of shared directory so frontend and backend could share types
- Updating mechanism instead of just resetting the DB each time you update it
- Better config for the frontend and backend such as including ESLint
