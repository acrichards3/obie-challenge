To get started, you'll need to set up a `.env` file. For this demo, if you would like to spin up this app on your end, you can copy the values from `.env.example` into a `.env`.

Package manager I'm using is `bun`, however, you can install with any other package manager you like:

```
bun i
bun run dev
```

Backend runs on port 3005

Db can be viewed in browser by running

`bun run db:studio`
